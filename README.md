## Abstract:
Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIv) H5N6 and H5N8 have occurred globally since 2018, but until recently, Cambodia detected mainly HPAI H5N1 viruses. In late 2021, HPAI H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4b viruses, likely originating from wild waterfowl, were detected in domestic ducks in several Cambodia poultry markets.
